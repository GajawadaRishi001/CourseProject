# CourseProject
With the integration of residual learning techniques into the architecture framework 
of U-Net, the model was able to define itself as a significant tool for improving the 
retinal vessel segmentation tasks. Additionally, this advancement further indicated 
that the model could perform well in the medical imaging field. The additional 
features of the model are summarized in the following points: 
#Model Performance: 
As a hybrid of Residual U-Net, this model showed remarkable 
segmentation results for the retinal vessels and surpassed the performance of 
classical methods in both metrics as well as accuracy. Its precision in segmentation 
of tiny details and intricate pattern of retinal images makes it clinically useful, 
providing support to Ophthalmologists in the diagnosis and follow up of diseases 
affecting the retina including diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.
